## Design and Implementation Plan for GitHub Copilot Task Master Project

### Overview
The GitHub Copilot Task Master project aims to create a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that leverages AI assistance to help users define project requirements, manage tasks through GitHub repositories, and provide a user-friendly interface for tracking project progress and making adjustments. This plan outlines the design, architecture, and implementation steps necessary to achieve this goal.

### Objectives
1. **AI-Assisted Project Requirement Definition**: Create a wizard that guides users through defining project requirements with AI assistance.
2. **Task Management**: Integrate with GitHub to manage tasks, issues, and pull requests.
3. **Progress Tracking**: Provide a dashboard for users to track project progress and make adjustments as needed.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure the extension is intuitive and easy to use.

### Architecture
The architecture of the GitHub Copilot Task Master will consist of the following components:

1. **VS Code Extension**: The main interface for users to interact with the Task Master.
2. **AI Service**: An AI model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to assist in generating project requirements and task descriptions.
3. **GitHub API Integration**: To manage tasks, issues, and pull requests directly from the extension.
4. **Local Storage**: To save user preferences and project configurations.
5. **Web Dashboard**: A web-based interface for advanced project tracking and management.

### Design Components

#### 1. User Interface (UI)
- **Wizard Interface**: A step-by-step wizard that guides users through defining project requirements.
  - **Step 1**: Project Overview (name, description, goals)
  - **Step 2**: Define Features (using AI to suggest features based on user input)
  - **Step 3**: Task Breakdown (AI-assisted task generation)
  - **Step 4**: GitHub Integration (linking to a repository)
  
- **Dashboard**: A visual representation of project progress.
  - **Task List**: Display tasks with statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)
  - **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator of overall project completion
  - **Adjustments Section**: Allow users to modify tasks and priorities

#### 2. AI Integration
- **AI Model**: Use OpenAI's API to generate project requirements and task descriptions.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts that effectively guide the AI to produce relevant outputs based on user input.

#### 3. GitHub Integration
- **Authentication**: Use OAuth to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Create and manage issues
  - Update task statuses
  - Fetch repository information

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize VS Code Extension**:
   - Use Yeoman generator for VS Code extensions.
   - Set up the project structure and dependencies.

2. **Configure AI Service**:
   - Set up OpenAI API access.
   - Create utility functions for interacting with the AI model.

3. **Set Up GitHub API Integration**:
   - Implement OAuth authentication flow.
   - Create functions to interact with GitHub's REST API.

#### Phase 2: Develop Wizard Interface
1. **Create Wizard UI**:
   - Use VS Code's Webview API to create the wizard interface.
   - Implement navigation between wizard steps.

2. **Integrate AI Assistance**:
   - Implement AI calls to generate project requirements and tasks.
   - Display AI-generated suggestions in the wizard.

#### Phase 3: Develop Dashboard
1. **Create Dashboard UI**:
   - Use Webview API to create a dashboard interface.
   - Implement task list and progress tracking components.

2. **Integrate GitHub Task Management**:
   - Fetch tasks from GitHub and display them in the dashboard.
   - Implement functionality to update task statuses and create new tasks.

#### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all components, including AI integration and GitHub API calls.

2. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the wizard and dashboard interfaces.
   - Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.

#### Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation
1. **Publish Extension**:
   - Package the extension and publish it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

2. **Create Documentation**:
   - Write user documentation detailing how to install and use the extension.
   - Include examples of project setups and AI interactions.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1 week
- **Total Duration**: Approximately 11 weeks

### Conclusion
The GitHub Copilot Task Master project aims to enhance project management through AI assistance and seamless integration with GitHub. By following this detailed design and implementation plan, we can create a powerful tool that simplifies task management and improves project tracking for developers.
