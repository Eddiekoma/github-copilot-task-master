## Design and Implementation Plan for GitHub Copilot Task Master Project

### Overview
The GitHub Copilot Task Master project aims to create a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that leverages AI assistance to help users define project requirements, manage tasks through GitHub repositories, and provide a user-friendly interface for tracking project progress and making adjustments. The project will consist of several components, including a wizard for project setup, task management features, and a dashboard for progress tracking.

### Objectives
1. **Wizard for Project Requirements**: Create an interactive wizard that guides users through defining project requirements with AI assistance.
2. **Task Management**: Integrate with GitHub to manage tasks, issues, and pull requests.
3. **Progress Tracking Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard to visualize project progress and allow users to make adjustments.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure the extension is intuitive and easy to use.

### Components
1. **VS Code Extension**: The main component that integrates with the VS Code environment.
2. **AI Assistance**: Utilize GitHub Copilot or similar AI models to assist users in defining project requirements.
3. **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub APIs to manage tasks and track project progress.
4. **User Interface**: Create a responsive UI for the wizard and dashboard.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Research and Planning
- **Research Existing Solutions**: Analyze existing task management tools and VS Code extensions to identify gaps and opportunities.
- **Define User Stories**: Create user stories to capture the needs and expectations of potential users.
- **Technical Feasibility Study**: Assess the technical requirements for integrating with GitHub and implementing AI features.

#### Phase 2: Design
- **Architecture Design**:
  - Define the overall architecture, including the VS Code extension, backend services, and AI integration.
  - Choose a tech stack (e.g., TypeScript for the extension, Node.js for backend services).
  
- **UI/UX Design**:
  - Create wireframes and mockups for the wizard and dashboard.
  - Design user flows for project setup, task management, and progress tracking.

- **API Design**:
  - Define the APIs needed for GitHub integration (e.g., fetching issues, creating tasks).
  - Design the AI assistance API for generating project requirements.

#### Phase 3: Development
- **Set Up Development Environment**:
  - Initialize a new VS Code extension project using Yeoman or a similar tool.
  - Set up a GitHub repository for version control.

- **Implement Wizard for Project Requirements**:
  - Create the UI for the wizard using VS Code's WebView API.
  - Integrate AI assistance to suggest project requirements based on user input.

- **Implement Task Management Features**:
  - Use GitHub APIs to fetch and manage issues and pull requests.
  - Implement features for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

- **Develop Progress Tracking Dashboard**:
  - Create a dashboard UI to visualize project progress using charts and graphs.
  - Implement functionality to display task statuses, completion rates, and other metrics.

- **User Interface Enhancements**:
  - Ensure the extension is responsive and accessible.
  - Implement user-friendly notifications and error handling.

#### Phase 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the VS Code extension, GitHub APIs, and AI services.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conduct testing sessions with potential users to gather feedback and make improvements.

#### Phase 5: Deployment
- **Publish the Extension**: Package the VS Code extension and publish it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for users, including installation instructions, usage guides, and troubleshooting tips.

#### Phase 6: Maintenance and Updates
- **Monitor User Feedback**: Continuously gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
- **Regular Updates**: Implement regular updates to add new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance.
