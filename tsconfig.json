## Design and Implementation Plan for GitHub Copilot Task Master Project

### Overview
The GitHub Copilot Task Master project aims to create a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that leverages AI assistance to help users define project requirements, manage tasks through GitHub repositories, and provide a user-friendly interface for tracking project progress and making adjustments. The project will consist of several components, including a wizard for project setup, task management features, and a dashboard for progress tracking.

### Objectives
1. **AI-Assisted Project Requirements Wizard**: Create a wizard that guides users through defining project requirements with AI suggestions.
2. **Task Management Integration**: Integrate with GitHub to manage tasks, issues, and pull requests.
3. **Progress Tracking Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard to visualize project progress and allow users to make adjustments.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure the extension is intuitive and easy to use.

### Components
1. **VS Code Extension**: The main application that users will install in their VS Code environment.
2. **AI Integration**: Utilize GitHub Copilot or other AI models to assist users in defining project requirements.
3. **GitHub API Integration**: Use GitHub's REST API to manage tasks and track project progress.
4. **Frontend UI**: Create a user interface for the wizard and dashboard using React or similar frameworks.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Research and Planning
- **Research Existing Solutions**: Analyze existing task management tools and VS Code extensions to identify gaps and opportunities.
- **Define User Stories**: Create user stories to capture the needs and expectations of potential users.
- **Technical Feasibility Study**: Assess the technical requirements for integrating AI and GitHub APIs.

#### Phase 2: Design
- **Architecture Design**:
  - Define the overall architecture, including the VS Code extension, backend services, and AI integration.
  - Create a flow diagram illustrating user interactions with the wizard, task management, and progress tracking.

- **UI/UX Design**:
  - Design wireframes for the wizard, task management interface, and progress dashboard.
  - Conduct user testing on wireframes to gather feedback and iterate on designs.

#### Phase 3: Development
- **Setup Development Environment**:
  - Initialize a new VS Code extension project using Yeoman or similar tools.
  - Set up a GitHub repository for version control.

- **Implement AI-Assisted Wizard**:
  - Create the wizard interface that guides users through defining project requirements.
  - Integrate AI capabilities to suggest requirements based on user input.

- **Integrate GitHub API**:
  - Implement authentication with GitHub using OAuth.
  - Create functions to manage tasks, issues, and pull requests through the GitHub API.

- **Develop Progress Tracking Dashboard**:
  - Create a dashboard that visualizes project progress using charts and graphs.
  - Implement features to adjust tasks and view historical data.

- **Frontend Development**:
  - Use React or a similar framework to build the user interface components.
  - Ensure responsiveness and accessibility in the design.

#### Phase 4: Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the VS Code extension, AI services, and GitHub API.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct testing sessions with real users to gather feedback and identify issues.

#### Phase 5: Deployment
- **Package the Extension**: Prepare the VS Code extension for distribution.
- **Publish to Marketplace**: Submit the extension to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- **Documentation**: Create user documentation and tutorials to help users get started.

#### Phase 6: Maintenance and Iteration
- **Monitor User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users and monitor usage analytics.
- **Iterate on Features**: Based on feedback, prioritize and implement new features or improvements.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the extension updated with the latest dependencies and security patches.
